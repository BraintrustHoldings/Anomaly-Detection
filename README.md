# Anomaly-Detection
This repository was created as part of an IRAD (Internal Research and Development) project to explore algorithms for anomaly detection in  network traffic.  It includes a white paper describing an anomaly detection algorithm and simple Python code to implement the algorithm. To make use of this repository, start by reading "Steps to Use Anomaly Detection Program" in the docs directory.
